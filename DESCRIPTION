Description: DUET-knockoff implemnets a knockoff-based framework for integrative feature selection from paired 16S and shotgun microbiome profiles. DUET-knockoff tests, for each taxon, a union null that it is not conditionally associated with the outcome in at least one platform, so discoveries reflect associations replicated across both technologies.
